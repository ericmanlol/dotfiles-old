**SublimeRope**
===========================

**Sublime Text 3 Support**: I started a complete rewrite of this plugin for ST3, which is a lot faster and easier to use, although it does not have all the features of SublimeRope yet. It's called SublimePython and you can find it [here](http://github.com/JulianEberius/SublimePython/).

Adds Python completions and some IDE-like functions to Sublime Text 2, through the use of the [Rope](http://rope.sourceforge.net/) library.

I have tested it on the latest dev build. It seems to work equally well on OSX, Linux and Windows, though I mostly test on OSX.
No guarantees here!
