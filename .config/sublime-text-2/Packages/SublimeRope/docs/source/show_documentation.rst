.. _show_documentation:

==================
Show Documentation
==================

To use the show documentation feature in SublimeRope just write the name of the function you are going to use and select the ``Rope: Show Documentation`` from the ST2's Control Palette. We suggest you use a key binding for this action.

Some Considerations
===================

The available documentation that will be accesible are determined by the :ref:`cache_mechanisms`.
